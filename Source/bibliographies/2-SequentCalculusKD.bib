abstract = "Masini, A., 2-Sequent calculus: a proof theory of modalities, Annals of Pure and Applied Logic 58 (1992) 229â€“246. In this work we propose an extension of the Getzen sequent calculus in order to deal with modalities. We extend the notion of a sequent obtaining what we call a 2-sequent. For the obtained calculus we prove a cut elimination theorem."
